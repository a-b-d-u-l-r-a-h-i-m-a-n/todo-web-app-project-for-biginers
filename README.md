# todo-web-app-project-for-biginers
Web Development Node.js Minor Project
Now that you have learned quite a few things in Node, Express and MongoDB, its time for your Minor Project!
You have to build a TODO List app. In this app, users can create to-do lists, where they can add list of Tasks. The Task created by user then should be stored in the Database.
Under each list, you can add "Cards," which are items in a list. You can add a due date, a checklist and labels to each card.
You are free to explore more and add interesting features to your TODO app.
